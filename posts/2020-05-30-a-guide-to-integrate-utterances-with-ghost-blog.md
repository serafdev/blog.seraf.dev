### Utterances Integration

So I came across a pretty cool open source project that letâ€™s you use github issues to integrate commenting to your blogposts.

Adding to this other pretty cool open source blog project named ghost, the combination to me is the best since I don't like reinventing the wheel.

For more information here is the link: https://utteranc.es/

For the blog: https://ghost.org

Basically, all you'll have to do is to copy the Utterance snippet and put it inside the `post.hbs` file, then zip the modified theme and upload it to your blog.

The snippet that you need to copy:

```bash
    <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="user/repo"
        issue-term="pathname"
        theme="github-dark"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
    </script>

```

For example, I use the Casper theme so I forked the official github repository of Casper and added that snippet there, then I Downloaded the repository as Zip and uploaded that to my Ghost blog.

Here's the permalink for the modified code:
